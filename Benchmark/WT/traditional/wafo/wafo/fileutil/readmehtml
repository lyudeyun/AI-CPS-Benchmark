mat2html is a perl script that reads each matlab .m file in a directory
to produce a corresponding .html file of help documentation and cross
reference information. An index file named index.html is written with
links to all of the html files produced. The options are:

  -h  Print this help message.
  -i  Include matlab source in the html documentation
  -M  To index a matlab directory different from the current directory.
  -H  To place html files in a different directory.

Typical usages are:

  mat2html
  mat2html -M matlab -H html

One useful thing
to do is, in your matlab directory, create an html directory. Then
do

mat2html -M /usr/local/src/matlab4.2/toolbox/.  -H html -i

Then open netscape or mosaic on the file html/index.html.

Presto, instant documentation on your favorite toolbox.
