% Output:

%   ARFC1   = Asymetric RFC (without resudual).       [N1,2]/[N1,4]

% Input:

%   def      = Choice of definition of rainflow cycles   [struct array]
%   def.res  = Treatment of residual.
%              'up':   Count min-to-Max cycles,    (default)
%                      gives correct number of upcrossings.
%              'down': Count Max-to-min cycles, 
%                      gives correct number of downcrossings.
%              'CS':   Cloormann/Seeger method, 
%                      gives all closed hysterisis loops.
%                      This method is identical to the French AFNOR recommendation, 
%                      and the ASTM standard (variant called simplified version).
%   def.time = 0: Don't store time of max and min. (default)
%              1: Store the time when the maxima and minima occured.

% Calculates the asymmetric rainflow cycles (ARFC) for the sequence of 
% turning points,  by using the so-called 4-point algorithm.
%
% It is possible to split the signal into smaller parts, and calculate 
% ARFC part by part. It can be especially useful for long signals.
% We count the first part and for the second part we continue counting 
% from previously counted 'ARFC0' with residual 'res0':
%   [ARFC1,ARFC0,res0] = tp2arfc(tp(1:1000,:));      % Firts 1000 points
%   [ARFC2] = tp2arfc(tp(1001:end,:),[],ARFC0,res0); % Point 1001 to end
% This shall give the same result as (i.e. ARFC=ARFC2)
%   [ARFC] = tp2arfc(tp);                            % Calculate all at once
%   sum(ARFC~=ARFC2)                                 % Shall return  [0 0]
%
% This routine doesn't use MEX, Fortran or C codes, only matlab code.
%
% Example:
%   x = load('sea.dat'); tp=dat2tp(x);
%   ARFC=tp2arfc(tp);      % Default (min-to-Max cycles in residual)
%   ccplot(ARFC);
%
%   close all;

% History:
% Revised by PJ 06-Jul-2005
%   Fixed error with def & mod to avoid warning i R14SP2.
% Revised by PJ 26-Jul-2000
%   New format of def.
% Revised by PJ 12-Jul-2000
%   Now calls 'tp2arfc4p' to calculate ARFC0 and res.
%   Input 'def_res'.
%   Now supports AFNOR and ASTM standards for rainflow counting.
