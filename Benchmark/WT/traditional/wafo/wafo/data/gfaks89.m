% Description      :
%   The wave data was measured 24th December 1989 at the Gullfaks C platform  
%   in the North Sea from 17.00 to 21.20. The period from 20.00 to 20.20
%   is missing and contains NaNs.  The water depth of 218 m is  
%   regarded as deep water for the most important wave components.
%   There are two EMI laser sensors named 219 and 220. This data set is 
%   obtained from sensor 219, which is located in the Northwest
%   corner approximately two platform leg diameters away from   
%   the closest leg.  
%   Thus the wave elevation is not expected to be significantly 
%   affected by diffraction effects for incoming waves in the western sector.   
%   The wind direction for this period is from the south.
%   Some difficulties in calibration of the instruments have been reported
%   resulting in several consecutive measured values being equal or almost equal 
%   in the observed data set.
