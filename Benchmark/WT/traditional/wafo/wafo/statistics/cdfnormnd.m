function [p, err, N] = cdfnormnd(x, mu, Sigma, errMax, ci, Nmax)
%CDFNORMND Multivariate normal cumulative distribution function (cdf).
%   P = CDFNORMND(X,MU,SIGMA) computes the multivariate normal cdf 
%   with mean vector MU and variance matrix SIGMA at the values in 
%   vector X.
%
%   P = CDFNORMND(X,MU,SIGMA,ERRMAX,CI,NMAX) uses additional control 
%   parameters. The difference between P and the true value of the
%   cdf is less than ERRMAX CI percent of the time. NMAX is the 
%   maximum number of iterations that the algorithm makes. By 
%   default, ERRMAX is 0.01, CI is 99, and NMAX is 300.
%
%   [P,ERR,N] = CDFNORMND(...) also returns the estimated error and the
%   number of iterations made.
