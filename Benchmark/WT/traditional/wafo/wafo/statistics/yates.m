function [ef, id]=yates(y,varargin)
%YATES Calculates main and interaction effects using Yates' algorithm.
%
% CALL:  [ef, id] = yates(y);
%
%  id = identification vector of main and interaction effects.
%  ef = vector of average response, main effects and interaction effects.
%  y  = calculated response from a two-level complete factorial design.
%
% YATES applies the  Yates' algorithm to the responses Y to obtain 
% average response, main effects and interaction effects. Y is assumed to
% be arranged in what is called standard order. (The order of the actual
% running should, of course, be random).  EF(1,:) is the
% average response and EF(2:end,:) contain the main effects and
% interaction effects corresponding to the vector ID.
% 
% YATES may also be used in analyzing data from any 2^(K-P) fractional
% factorial design. The algorithm is applied in the usual way to any ambedded
% complete factorial in K-P factors, i.e., the responses must be
% rearranged so that K-P factors is a complete factorial in standard order.
% Then associate the calculated effects with their appropriate aliases
% using ALIAS. 
%
% Example:
%   D = ffd(3);                    % complete 2^3 design in standard order.
%   y = [60 72 54 68 52 83 45 80]; % Responses to design D.
%   [ef,id] = yates(y);
%
%   I = sudg(7,4);
%   D1 = ffd(7,I);                  % 2^(7-4) design in standard order.
%   y1 = [69 52 60 83 71 50 59 88]; % Responses to design D1.
%   [ef1,id1] = yates(y1);
%   I3 = alias(cdr(I),3);                 % associate with id1
