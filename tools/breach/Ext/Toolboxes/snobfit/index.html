SNOBFIT (Stable Noisy Optimization by Branch and FIT)
is a MATLAB 6 package for the robust and fast solution of 
noisy optimization problems with continuous variables varying 
within bound, possibly subject to additional soft constraints.
Discrete variables are not supported.
<P>
Objective function values must be provided by a file-based interface;
care is taken that the optimization proceeds reasonably even when 
the interface produces noisy or even occasionally undefined 
results (hidden constraints). 
The interface makes it possible to use SNOBFIT with new data entered 
by hand, or by any automatic or semiautomatic experimental system. 
<P>
This makes SNOBFIT very suitable for applications to the selection of 
continuous parameter settings for simulations or experiments, 
performed with the goal of optimizing some user-specified criterion.
Since multiple data points can be entered, SNOBFIT can take advantage
of parallel function evaluations.
<P>
The method combines a branching strategy to enhance the chance of 
finding a global minimum with a sequential quadratic programming 
method based on fitted quadratic models to have good local properties.
Various safeguards address many possible pitfalls that may arise in
practical applications, for which most other optimization routines 
are ill-prepared. Soft constraints are taken care of by a new 
penalty-type method with strong theoretical properties.
<P>
In order to use SNOBFIT, one needs the

MINQ</A> bound-constrained quadratic programming package.
